MPEG::MP3Info is now MP3::Info.  Please fetch that distribution instead.
You can continue to use MPEG::MP3Info (without changing your scripts)
with the MPEG::MP3Info wrapper module that comes with MP3::Info.

The archive can always be obtained from:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mp3-info/
    http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/
    http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/MP3/

This distribution is useless without MP3::Info.  So go get that one
instead.
