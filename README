Check out the script from Meng Weng Wong in eg/, it's pretty cool, and
if you have the unreleased CDDB module, it will be even cooler.

NAME
    MPEG::MP3Info - Manipulate / fetch info from MP3 audio files

SYNOPSIS
        #!perl -w
        use MPEG::MP3Info;
        my $file = 'Pearls_Before_Swine.mp3';
        set_mp3tag($file, 'Pearls Before Swine', q"77's",
          'Sticks and Stones', '1990', q"(c) 1990 77's LTD.", 'rock & roll');

        my $tag = get_mp3tag($file) or die "No TAG info";
        $tag->{GENRE} = 'rock';
        set_mp3tag($file, $tag);

        my $info = get_mp3info($file);
        printf "$file length is %d:%d", $info->{MM}, $info->{SS};

DESCRIPTION
    use_winamp_genres()
    Puts WinAmp genres into `@mp3_genres' and `%mp3_genres'.

    Import the data structures with one of:

        use MPEG::MP3Info qw(:genres);
        use MPEG::MP3Info qw(:DEFAULT :genres);
        use MPEG::MP3Info qw(:all);

    remove_mp3tag (FILE)
    Removes last 128 bytes from file if those last 128 bytes begin with
    the text `TAG'. File will be 128 bytes shorter. Returns undef if no
    existing TAG found, 1 on successful removal of TAG.

    set_mp3tag (FILE, TITLE, ARTIST, ALBUM, YEAR, COMMENT, GENRE)
    set_mp3tag (FILE, $HASHREF)
    Adds/changes tag information in an MP3 audio file. Will clobber any
    existing information in file. All fields have a 30-byte limit, except
    for YEAR, which has a four-byte limit.

    GENRE is a case-insensitive text string representing a genre found in
    `@mp3_genres'.

    Will accept either a list of values, or a hashref of the type returned
    by `get_mp3tag'.

    get_mp3tag (FILE)
    Returns hash reference containing tag information in MP3 file. Same
    info as described in `set_mp3tag'. You can't change this data.

    get_mp3info (FILE)
    Returns hash reference containing file information for MP3 file.

HISTORY
    v0.52, Sunday, February 21, 1999
        Fixed problem in `get_mp3tag' that changed value of `$_' in caller
        (Todd Hanneken <thanneken@hds.harvard.edu>).

    v0.51, Saturday, February 20, 1999
        Fixed problem with `%winamp_genres' having the wrong numbers
        (Matthew Sachs).

    v0.50, Friday, February 19, 1999
        Added `remove_mp3tag'. Addeed VERSION to the hash returned by
        `get_mp3info', and fixed a bug where STEREO was not being set
        correctly.

        Export all genre data structures on request. Added
        `use_winamp_genres' to use WinAmp genres (Roland Steinbach
        <roland@support-system.com>).

        Added a `$MPEG::MP3Info::try_harder' variable that will try harder
        to find the MP3 header in a file. False by default. Can take a
        long time to fail, but should find most headers at any offets if
        set to true.

        Thanks to Matthew Sachs for his input and fixes.

        Thanks also to Peter Kovacs <kovacsp@egr.uri.edu>.

    v0.20, Saturday, October 17, 1998
        Changed name from `MPEG::MP3Tag' to `MPEG::MP3Info', because it
        does more than just TAG stuff now.

        Made header stuff even more reliable. Lots of help and testing
        from Meng Weng Wong again. :-)

    v0.13, Thursday, October 8, 1998
        Had some problems with header verification, got some code from
        Predrag Supurovic:

            mailto:mpgtools@dv.co.yu
            http://www.dv.co.yu/mp3list/mpgtools.htm
            http://www.dv.co.yu/mp3list/mpeghdr.htm

        Great stuff. Also did some looping to find a header if it is not
        in the "right" place. I did what I think it is a smart way to do
        it, since some files have the header as far down as 2 kbytes into
        the file. First, I look at position 0, then at position 36 (a
        position where I have found many headers), then I start at 0 again
        and jump in 128-byte chunks. Once I do that a bunch of times, I go
        back at the beginning and try at 0 and go ahead in 1-byte chunks
        for a bunch more times.

        If you have an MP3 that has the header begin at an odd place like
        byte 761, then I suggest you strip out the junk before the header
        begins. :-)

    v0.12, Friday, October 2, 1998
        Added `get_mp3info'. Thanks again to mp3tool source from Johann
        Lindvall, because I basically stole it straight (after converting
        it from C to Perl, of course).

        I did everything I could to find the header info, but if anyone
        has valid MP3 files that are not recognized, or has suggestions
        for improvement of the algorithms, let me know.

    v0.04, Tuesday, September 29, 1998
        Changed a few things, replaced a regex with an `unpack' (Meng Weng
        Wong <mengwong@pobox.com>).

    v0.03, Tuesday, September 8, 1998
        First public release.
